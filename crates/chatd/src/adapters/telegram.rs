//! Telegram: the one network whose terms welcome a third-party client. Chat first; calls hand
//! off to Telegram's own app for now.
//!
//! # The library: grammers, in this process (decided 2026-10-13, by measurement on this Mac)
//!
//! | | TDLib (C++, Telegram's own) | grammers 0.10 (pure Rust MTProto) |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | Builds here | No: needs CMake, which Command Line Tools lack. Usable only prebuilt. | Yes, 27 s cold, once `glass_pumpkin` is pinned (see `Cargo.toml`). |
//! | Prebuilt | None from Telegram. npm `@prebuilt-tdlib/darwin-arm64` (one maintainer's CI, ad-hoc signed, static OpenSSL, needs macOS 14) is the only shippable one; PyPI `tdjson` bundles end-of-life OpenSSL 1.1.1; Homebrew's bottle is TDLib 1.8.0 from 2021 and links Homebrew's OpenSSL. | Not needed. |
//! | On disk | 31.9 MB dylib (11.7 MB compressed). | Linked in; see the README's size table. |
//! | Idle memory | +2.8 MB footprint loaded with no parameters set: a floor. With its database and a connection it could not be measured without an app id; the docs' estimate is 20 to 50 MB. | +0.2 MB footprint, +1.2 MB RSS over an empty process, measured connected to a datacenter with the key exchange done. |
//! | Second cache | Its own SQLite beside ours: every message stored twice. | None: messages go to chatd's store as they arrive. |
//! | Maintained | By Telegram. | One maintainer plus contributors; archived on GitHub 2026-02-10 and moved to Codeberg, where it is active: 0.10.0 on 2026-07-02, schema layer bumped 2026-10-10, commits the day this was written. |
//! | Covers | Everything, secret chats and call signalling included. | Phone login and 2FA as methods; QR login, folders, topics, reactions, typing, read state and files through its raw request call, which reaches the whole schema. No secret chats, no calls. |
//!
//! grammers wins on the two things this app is about, weight and one cache, and it is the only
//! one of the two that can be built on the machine tinyclient is developed on. What it costs: a
//! schema change at Telegram waits on one maintainer, secret chats are out, and calls (a later
//! stage, tgcalls either way) will need their signalling written here. If grammers is ever
//! abandoned, everything above `wire::Wire` speaks Telegram's schema, not grammers, so the
//! transport can be replaced without touching the mapping.
//!
//! chatd stays inside its budget, so Telegram is not a process of its own. grammers is async:
//! one current-thread tokio runtime, on the adapter's own thread (`real`), built when an account
//! exists or a sign-in begins and at no other time.
//!
//! # The app id
//!
//! Telegram wants one registered `api_id` per app, shipped in the binary and kept out of the
//! repository. It is read at build time from `TINYCLIENT_TELEGRAM_API_ID` and
//! `TINYCLIENT_TELEGRAM_API_HASH`. Built without them, Telegram is `Unsupported` and says why.
//!
//! # The session
//!
//! One keychain item, like every network: the keys Telegram issued (256 bytes a datacenter),
//! the home datacenter and whose they are, as JSON (`Saved`). Nothing of it is on disk.
//!
//! # What the terms bind (`docs/product/08-sign-in-accounts.md`)
//!
//! Reading is told to Telegram exactly when the shell says a message was seen, typing while the
//! user types, and being here when the user acts; no setting hides any of the three. Nothing is
//! automated. A flood wait is slept in full or told to the user, never cut short. A channel's
//! sponsored message is asked when the channel is opened (at most every five minutes) and told
//! as viewed once it is on screen.
//!
//! # Unproven
//!
//! Nobody has signed in through this yet: there was no app id and no account when it was
//! written. The mapping, the choice of requests and the sign-in steps are tested through chatd's
//! socket against a scripted wire (`fake`); `real` has only been run as far as a datacenter's
//! refusal of a missing app id.
