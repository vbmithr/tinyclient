//! One adapter per account. Each speaks its network's own protocol and nothing else.
//!
//! This file is the whole surface between an adapter and the rest of chatd:
//!
//! - [`Command`] is everything chatd asks of an adapter. An adapter serves the ones it can and
//!   hands the rest to [`Command::unsupported`], so a new command never breaks an adapter.
//! - [`Context`] is everything an adapter tells chatd. Each call writes the store and announces
//!   the right change; an adapter never touches the store's tables or the change list itself.
//! - An adapter's module exports `start`, `accounts` and `without` (see the functions of those
//!   names at the bottom), and reads its addresses through [`net::address`] so a test can point
//!   it at a local fake.
//!
//! Adapters hold bounded state: trees, people and messages go to the store as they arrive.
//!
//! Nothing here acts for the user unasked. A friend request is answered, a presence set, a
//! message edited, deleted or reacted to only by the command the shell's request became.
