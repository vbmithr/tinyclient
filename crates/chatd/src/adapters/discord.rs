//! Discord, signed in as the user: the gateway websocket for everything live, the HTTP API for
//! history and for what the user does.
//!
//! The socket thread (`gateway.rs`) holds the gateway, turns its events into
//! `Context` calls and is the only one that writes to the socket; the command thread serves
//! HTTP commands and hands gateway sends to the socket thread's outbox. A separate
//! viewport thread serves cache reads and Watch updates without waiting for HTTP/backfill.
//!
//! What stays in memory is bounded and listed on [`State`]: roles and ids per server, the lists
//! the user owns, one visible member window, the voice states of the servers. Trees, people and
//! messages go to the store as READY and the events arrive.
